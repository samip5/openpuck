# OpenPuck Controller Protocol

This document describes the complete controller-to-puck protocol implemented by `OpenPuck.ino`.

## 1. Scope

OpenPuck emulates the Valve Steam Controller 2 "puck" dongle. There are two separate protocols:

1. USB host-facing protocol between the puck and the computer.
2. 2.4 GHz radio protocol between the puck and the controller.

Both are required for a fully compatible implementation.

## 2. Bond record

A bond slot is 24 bytes:

```text
offset  size  meaning
0x00    4     proteus_uuid / token, little-endian
0x04    4     ibex_uuid, little-endian
0x08    16    controller serial, ASCII, not null-terminated if fully filled
```

The puck stores four independent bond slots. Slot `N` is exposed as USB HID interface `N`.

An empty slot is all zeroes.

## 3. USB protocol

### 3.1 Steam-mode USB layout

Steam mode enumerates as Valve `28DE:1142` and exposes four HID interfaces with the same report descriptor as the real puck. Each interface owns one bond slot. The firmware uses the classic Steam Controller dongle PID because SDL's Steam HIDAPI driver reliably treats `0x1142` as the four-slot wireless receiver; newer puck PIDs may work in Steam but are not consistently surfaced as Steam Controllers to SDL apps. SDL also expects the Steam slot HIDs on USB interface numbers 1..4, so WebUSB is registered before the slot HIDs in puck mode to reserve interface 0.

Relevant report IDs:

- Input: `0x40`, `0x41`, `0x42`, `0x43`, `0x44`, `0x45`, `0x79`, `0x7B`
- Output: `0x80` to `0x89`
- Feature: `0x01`, `0x02`

### 3.2 Feature commands

Feature payload framing is:

```text
[cmd][len][payload...]
```

Implemented commands:

- `0x83`: attribute block
- `0xAE`: string attribute
- `0xB4`: connection state for the interface's slot
- `0xAD`: pairing mode enable/disable
- `0xA2`: write or clear the interface's 24-byte bond slot
- `0xA3`: read the interface's 24-byte bond slot

#### `0xB4` response

```text
[0xB4][0x01][state]
```

- `0x02`: controller connected on this slot
- `0x01`: not connected

#### `0xA2` write

`len` must be at least `24`. A zero-filled 24-byte payload clears the slot. Any non-zero valid payload writes the bond verbatim.

#### `0xA3` read

Returns:

```text
[0xA3][0x18][24-byte bond]
```

### 3.3 Host-to-controller relay

When Steam writes feature report `0x01`, OpenPuck forwards it over RF to the controller as an `E3` frame
containing a sub-TLV. There are two on-air forms:

```text
legacy   [E3][1+len][0x05][report_id][data...]              (no inner-len)
landing  [E3][2+len][0x01][report_id][innerlen][data...]    (type 01, KEEPS inner-len; controller ACTS on it)
```

A command only **lands** on the controller in the `landing` form (type `0x01` — the same type byte the GET poll
uses, `E3 02 01 45 <param>`; the `report_id` selects the action, `innerlen` is the report's own `[len]`). In the
`legacy` form the controller discards any `0x87+` command (it reads the first data byte as the length).

**OpenPuck sends the `legacy` form for everything EXCEPT a tight whitelist** — only LED brightness (`0x87` whose
first register byte is `0x2D`) and controller power-off (`0x9F`) use the `landing` form:

```text
haptic on    E3 04 05 82 01 01 F7              (report 0x82, legacy)
brightness   E3 05 01 87 03 2D <val> 00        (report 0x87 reg 0x2D, LANDING -- whitelisted)
power-off    E3 06 01 9F 04 6F 66 66 21        (report 0x9F "off!", LANDING -- whitelisted)
Steam 0x87 cfg  E3 .. 05 87 ..                 (haptic/IMU config: legacy -> DISCARDED, by design)
```

**Why the whitelist is tight, not "land everything `0x87+`":** Steam continuously writes its own `0x87`
passthrough during normal play — the haptic-config block including reg `0x30` (IMU/subsystem enable) and
`0x34/0x35` (haptic amplitude). If those *land*, reg `0x30` **freezes the controller's gyro stream** and
`0x34/0x35` drive the **connect-time buzz**. The long-working build never landed any `0x87`, so neither happened.
Landing the whole class regresses both (stuck gyro + buzz); landing only the brightness register and power-off
adds those two features while leaving Steam's config writes discarded exactly as before.

The relay carries the command's declared length, up to 60 bytes — the most one RF frame fits. Relays are staged
in a small ring (not a single buffer): the USB SET callbacks run in ISR context and Steam sends
settings/calibration as back-to-back bursts, so a single pending slot both drops reports and can be torn
mid-flush. One queued relay is emitted per poll cycle.

### 3.4 Connection presentation (input reports `0x79` / `0x7B`)

- `0x79` (1 byte): connection state, `0x02` = connected, `0x01` = disconnected. **Edge-triggered**, like the
  real puck. OpenPuck additionally re-sends it every 750 ms after a connect edge *until Steam reacts* (its
  first OUTPUT/settings write after the edge), covering a missed edge. It must not be re-sent unconditionally:
  each `0x79=02` can re-trigger Steam's connect handling (connect chime) and loop the haptic before Steam
  starts consuming `0x45`.
- `0x7B` (12 bytes): periodic status, sent every 2 s while connected. Byte 8 is the controller→puck signal
  strength as **signed dBm** (live-captured example `0xDD` = −35 dBm). OpenPuck fills it with the smoothed
  radio RSSI sampled on each CRC-good controller reply (`RSSISAMPLE`, started by an `ADDRESS→RSSISTART`
  short during the poll RX window). The other bytes are replayed from the live capture
  (`F7 01 89 00 00 00 03 00 __ 00 3A 02`); their semantics are unconfirmed.

## 4. Radio physical layer

OpenPuck uses Nordic raw radio mode configured to match the puck firmware:

- PHY: `Ble_2Mbit`
- Dynamic-length packet format
- `PCNF0 = 0x00030008`
- `PCNF1 = 0x01040040`
- 5-byte address (`BALEN=4`)
- Big-endian
- Whitening disabled
- CRC16, address included
- Polynomial `0x11021`
- Init `0xFFFF`

CRC is standard CRC-16-CCITT over address plus payload, MSB-first.

### 4.1 Address transform

Stored address bytes are converted to on-air address bytes by bit-reversing each byte.

For the nRF `BASE0` register, the bit-reversed base bytes are then packed big-endian:

```text
BASE0 = bitrev8(base[0]) << 24 |
        bitrev8(base[1]) << 16 |
        bitrev8(base[2]) <<  8 |
        bitrev8(base[3])

PREFIX0 = bitrev8(prefix)
```

## 5. Discovery / reconnect

Discovery uses a fixed address and fixed channel:

- Base bytes: ASCII `"ibex"` = `69 62 65 78`
- Prefix: `0x10`
- Channel: `2`

The puck transmits a host frame on that address until the controller connects.

## 6. Host frame (`E1`)

OpenPuck's discovery host frame is a dynamic-length ESB payload:

```text
RAM buffer:
[0]  = 0x12                     ; payload length
[1]  = S1 byte                  ; PID in bits 1..2, no-ack bit clear
[2]  = 0xE1                     ; host-frame opcode
[3..6]   = proteus_uuid         ; 4 bytes, little-endian
[7..10]  = ibex_uuid            ; 4 bytes, little-endian
[11]     = session channel
[12..14] = 0x00 0x00 0x00
[15..18] = session base         ; 4 bytes, stored form
[19]     = session prefix
```

Semantics:

- `proteus_uuid` is the first 4 bytes of the bond record.
- `ibex_uuid` is the next 4 bytes of the bond record.
- The host chooses the connected-session channel and address and advertises them here.

## 7. Connected session

After discovery, the puck becomes the poll master.

### 7.1 Controller wake / version frame (`E7`)

OpenPuck sends:

```text
E7 00 00
```

This is the normal "host awake" form.

### 7.2 Input poll (`E3`)

OpenPuck polls for report `0x45` using:

```text
E3 [len] 0x01 0x45 [param]
```

- `0x01`: GET subtype
- `0x45`: controller input report
- `param`: implementation tunable, usually `0x00` or `0x2D`

The controller replies in the ACK window.

### 7.3 Controller replies

Observed reply opcodes:

- `0xF1`: full TLV container carrying input data
- `0xF2`: disconnect / shutdown
- `0xF3`: status

#### `0xF1` container

The TLV scan starts at byte 6. Each record is:

```text
[len][tag][value...]
```

Known tags:

- `0x02`: 4-byte control/status field
- `0x04`: bulk data blob
- `0x06`: embedded report wrapper

For controller input, the embedded report is `0x45`.

## 8. Report `0x45` layout

Report `0x45` is 46 bytes:

```text
offset  size  meaning
0x00    1     report id = 0x45
0x01    1     sequence
0x02    4     buttons, little-endian u32
0x06    2     left trigger, u16
0x08    2     right trigger, u16
0x0A    2     left stick X, s16
0x0C    2     left stick Y, s16
0x0E    2     right stick X, s16
0x10    2     right stick Y, s16
0x12    2     left pad X, s16
0x14    2     left pad Y, s16
0x16    2     left pad press, s16
0x18    2     right pad X, s16
0x1A    2     right pad Y, s16
0x1C    2     right pad press, s16
0x1E    4     IMU timestamp, u32
0x22    2     accel X, s16
0x24    2     accel Y, s16
0x26    2     accel Z, s16
0x28    2     gyro X, s16
0x2A    2     gyro Y, s16
0x2C    2     gyro Z, s16
```

## 9. USB presentation modes

The RF side stays the same across modes. Only USB enumeration changes.

There are three switchable modes (`0=Steam 1=Xbox 2=Switch`). Steam mode is a CDC + WebUSB composite;
Xbox and Switch are **clean controller-only** devices — the auto-added CDC/WebUSB
interfaces are torn down (`clearConfiguration`) and `bcdUSB` stays `0x0200` (no USB-2.1 BOS). This is
required because Windows' `xusb` driver expects the Xbox 360 controller on the primary device/interface,
and a real Switch console rejects composite devices. Every boot/mode-switch
does a `detach -> rebuild -> attach` so the host re-reads the descriptor cleanly.

### 9.1 Steam mode

- VID:PID `28DE:1142`
- Four puck HID interfaces (CDC + WebUSB also present)
- `0x45` reports are forwarded to the connected slot's HID interface
- **Seamless lizard**: when Steam is driving the device, `0x45` is forwarded; when it isn't
  (Steam closed, 7 s watchdog) the same `0x45` is translated into mouse (`0x40`) + keyboard (`0x41`)
  reports on the **same** puck interface, so the device is a driverless desktop keyboard+mouse with no
  mode switch. This is purely USB-side; the RF poll and relay are unchanged. (There is no standalone
  lizard mode.)
- **"Steam is driving" signal**: *any* Steam OUTPUT/settings report (`0x80`–`0x89`, e.g. the `0x87`
  lizard-off heartbeat, LED, or a `0x82` haptic) refreshes the watchdog — not just `0x87`. This makes
  the puck leave lizard for gamepad on Steam's **first** contact, even if that first packet is a haptic
  that arrives before the heartbeat.
- **Haptics are gated on this decision**: haptic reports are **never** relayed to the controller while
  the puck is presenting lizard. Relaying haptics while Steam isn't reading `0x45` back made Steam loop
  the same command, leaving the controller buzzing; suppressing them keeps the lizard state clean. The
  same gate applies during the post-resume input mute (`POST_RESUME_MUTE_MS`): Steam can't read `0x45`
  back in that window either, so a wake-time haptic would loop identically.
- **Which OUTPUT reports are relayed**: the haptic/actuator reports `0x80`–`0x86` are forwarded to the
  **connected slot only** (the slot gate is what stops a haptic aimed at another of the four exposed
  slots from buzzing the single controller). The 63-byte settings/config reports `0x87`/`0x88`/`0x89`
  are not haptics and are not pushed on this path (`0x87` lizard-off reaches the controller via the
  feature `0x01` passthrough). Restricting this to `0x82` alone silently dropped the ping/grip/test
  haptics, which use other report IDs.

### 9.2 Xbox mode

- VID:PID `045E:028E`, clean device (no CDC/WebUSB)
- Custom XInput-compatible vendor interface on `MI_00` + HID boot mouse on `MI_01` (right-pad emulation)
- `0x45` is converted into a 20-byte XInput report

### 9.3 Switch mode

- VID:PID `0F0D:0092` (HORI Pokkén Tournament Pro Pad), clean device (no CDC/WebUSB)
- Single HID interface with the canonical HORIPAD descriptor (interrupt IN + OUT endpoints), accepted by
  a real Switch console with no handshake; an 8-byte report is streamed at ~250 Hz

## 10. WebUSB control channel

The WebUSB vendor interface is present only in Steam mode (Xbox/Switch are clean controllers with no
config interface — configure them from Steam mode or switch via the back-paddle chord).

Messages:

- Host to device:
  - `0x01`: get status blob
  - `0x02 <field> <value>`: set one field
  - `0x03 <mode>`: switch mode and reboot
- Device to host:
  - `0xA5 <len> <payload>`

Status blob payload:

```text
[0]  version
[1]  usb mode
[2]  xbox mouse sensitivity divisor
[3]  xbox mouse friction
[4]  steam pad smoothing
[5]  A/B + X/Y swap
[6]  back mapping 0
[7]  back mapping 1
[8]  back mapping 2
[9]  back mapping 3
[10] connected slot or 0xFF
[11] link up flag
[12] delivered reports/s low
[13] delivered reports/s high
[14] poll interval / 100
[15] new reports/s low
[16] new reports/s high
[17] E7 mode byte
[18] relay opcode
[19] relay subtype
[20] forward-new-only flag
[21] QoS auto-hop flag
[22] persist-mode flag
```

## 11. Timing notes

- Default poll interval: `4000` microseconds (250 Hz, matches SC2 report rate)
- Default RX window: `1200` microseconds
- Discovery beacon continues on channel 2 even after a connected session exists
- Connected session can be moved to a cleaner channel such as 18 or 52

## 12. Reimplementation checklist

To build a compatible puck from scratch:

1. Expose four independent bond slots over USB.
2. Implement `0x83`, `0xAE`, `0xB4`, `0xAD`, `0xA2`, `0xA3`.
3. Persist 24-byte bond records exactly.
4. Configure the radio exactly as described above.
5. Beacon `E1` host frames on `"ibex"` / prefix `0x10` / channel 2.
6. Poll with `E7` then `E3 GET 0x45`.
7. Parse `F1` and unpack report `0x45`.
8. Relay host feature writes to the controller as `E3` SET sub-TLVs.
9. Re-enumerate USB cleanly when switching Steam/Xbox/Switch modes (Xbox/Switch as clean non-composite devices).

If those pieces match, the controller-to-puck protocol is fully reimplemented.
