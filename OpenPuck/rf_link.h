// rf_link.h -- the operational puck<->controller RF protocol (the "dongle" role).
//
// Built on the radio HW layer (radio.cpp), this is what makes the device act as a puck once a controller is
// bonded: it transmits the host frame the bonded controller reconnects on, runs the connected-mode poll loop
// (E7 awake announce -> E3 + GET-report-0x45 each cycle), and decodes the controller's 0xF1 input reply. The
// decode fills the shared g_in (triton.h) and dispatches to the active IController; it also handles the
// mode-switch chord, USB remote-wakeup on a Steam short-press, adaptive channel hopping (QoS), and the
// host-frame keepalive beacons. RE/calibration scaffolding lives separately in rf_diag.cpp.
//
// RECIPE: a live air capture of a real puck<->controller RECONNECT (sniff1.json) shows the controller streams
// 0xF1 input in response to a BARE 0xE3 poll -- with NO 0xE7 awake-announce and NO GET-report-0x45 sub-TLV.
// So the only thing OpenPuck genuinely needs to (re)establish the stream is connstate==3, which the host frame
// (0xE1) sets up; once connected, bare E3 polls keep F1 flowing. (The earlier RE hypothesis that E7+GET-0x45
// were required is contradicted by the capture -- see g_pollGet/g_e7announce.) The real puck also sends no E1
// on its session channel (its bonded controller resumes on the known per-bond address); OpenPuck still beacons
// E1 only because it runs the SHARED "ibex" address, not the per-bond one (g_e1keepalive).
// F1 reply = type 0xF1 then TLV type4(analog/buttons)+type6(per-module gyro/accel/sticks).
