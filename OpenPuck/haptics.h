// haptics.h -- host -> controller relay queue (haptics + settings) + the watchdogs that stop a stuck buzz.
//
// Steam and translated host rumble send OUTPUT/feature reports the real dongle forwards to the controller as
// a SET sub-TLV inside the E3 poll. We do the same: handleSet()/the console enqueue with relayEnqueue(), and
// rfConnFlushRelay() emits ONE entry per poll cycle (rf_link.cpp), never at raw loop rate.
//
// The queue is a small ring, NOT a single buffer: producers run in USB-ISR context while the consumer may be
// mid-flush in loop context, and Steam writes settings/calibration as bursts of back-to-back feature reports.
// The old single g_relayBuf both LOST every report that arrived before the previous one flushed and could be
// TORN mid-copy by the ISR (a half-old-half-new command on the air) -- the settings-never-save and the
// corrupted-haptic-latch bugs. Entries carry up to RELAY_MAXP payload bytes (the RF frame fits 60: [E3][len]
// [05][rid] + payload <= MAXLEN 64); the old path truncated everything to 18, which chopped any multi-register
// 0x87 settings block (LED brightness) and calibration write.
//
// The controller's haptic LATCHES until told to stop. If the host's stop is lost over RF (or the link drops
// mid-buzz) the actuator whines forever -- so we send 0x82-zero stop bursts on reconnect, but ONLY when a
// haptic was actually active when the link dropped: every extra 0x82 frame is an audible click on the
// controller (captured), so the old unconditional burst on each link-up edge was itself a buzz source on a
// flapping link. The g_hapLog ring captures recent OUTPUT reports for the 'H' dump.
