# OpenPuck
Opensource firmware for NRF52840 Pro Micro that copycats the Steam Controller 2 Puck and adds an Xbox and Switch mode.

> [!WARNING]
> Every part of this project _HEAVILY_ used LLMs. Everything from discovery of the protocol to writing the arduino sketch and running various automated benchmarks invovled Claude and Codex. This readme is the only organic, single origin, ethically sourced and humanely slaughtered thing in this proejct. I have done my best to review the code and I invite anyone concerned about the stability or security of this project to do the same.

# The Steam Controller 2
Released in 2026, the Steam Controller 2 represents the peak (IMO) of controller design. Trackpads, gyro, 4 back buttons, all with the flexibility of Steam Input brings the amazing flexiblity of the Steam Deck's controls to gaming PCs in general.

The "puck" is what the controller uses for wireless communication with the host device. It can handle 4 controllers paired to it at the same time and can run at a very low latency with all 4 connected. While the controller has a bluetooth mode too it has over twice the latency so the puck is truly where it's at.

# The Problem
There are two fundamental problems with the controller:

1. The puck is not (yet) available for purchase separately from the controller so if you want a replacement or a second one (a single controller can pair to two) you're out of luck.

2. Steam Input isn't just a nicety, it's a requirement. This means that the controller is basically useless unless you have Steam running (outside of certain contexts that I personally consider niche). If, for example, you have gamepass and want to play FH6 through Gamepass you're gonna be in for a bad time and you'll probalby need specialized software running on your computer in order to make the controller work with it.

# What this project does
OpenPuck uses a [Pro Micro NRF52840](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GSZ7FD6T) ($8 on Amazon, possibly cheaper elsewhere) which uses a radio similar to the one being used by the controller and the puck. Once the arduino sketch is uploaded it emulates the puck over USB to Steam by default and allows pairing the controller normally (almost, the lizard mode for when Steam is off might not be 1:1).

At any point you can hold all 4 back buttons and press X to switch over to ***Xbox mode** which maps all canonical inputs to their expected counterparts (plus L4 -> LB, L5 -> L3, etc which are configurable). In this mode the right trackpad acts as a mouse.

Similarly you can hold all 4 back buttons and press Y to switch (teehee) over to a **Switch mode**. This emulates a Pokken controller and is very limited (no gyro, no haptics, etc) but it's functional enough for my kids to play Animal Crossing :D.

# How to use it
You will need to flash OpenPuck.ino onto a compatible microcontroller. See [build instructions document](./docs/BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md) for more details.

# Configuration
A webusb based configuration UI is available [here](https://safijari.github.io/openpuck). It allows Switching the mode manually and changing the back button mapping for Xbox mode among other things. This will likely only work in Chrome and Edge and needs the pro micro to be connected via USB to the same computer for it to function.

# Contributions
I have tested this software fairly extensively but I have limited resources. I only have one controller so I actually don't know if multiple controllers even work correctly (in fact I'm almost sure they will not). Please submit issues with any issues you find. PRs also welcome of course.
